\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Chris, and I am a data scientist and software engineer. I am currently wrapping up my master's in artificial intelligence at the University of Georgia, for which I have completed all course work. I have a strong background in engineering, artificial intelligence, and data science, with bachelor degrees in both computer science and cognitive science, along with multiple internships in software engineering. As my graduate studies come to a close, I am seeking full-time employment in Atlanta where I can leverage machine learning to solve real world problems and build systems to bring those solutions to scale.

\lettersection{Why The Home Depot?}
I recently had the opportunity to meet a pair of engineers from The Home Depot at UGA, and I was thoroughly impressed. They spoke highly of the company, especially with respect to developer empowerment. I was most excited by the emerging commitment to open source (and I believe I was the first external contributor to Flow, raising an issue about licensing). Today, I'm happy to see that The Home Depot has published a progressive OSS manifesto along with a greater number of open source projects. I was also excited to hear of a strong ``hackathon'' culture, which I believe is important for maintaining developer morale and creativity. And in general, I am impressed by all that The Home Depot does to promote community programs across Atlanta.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My master's thesis has centered around machine learning and data science with high dimensional numeric datasets. I have developed a netCDF data ingestion pipeline to enable further statistical analysis in a distributed setting. I have utilized several modeling frameworks, including gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. This work has leveraged Scikit-learn and PyTorch, and I have experience developing and deploying big data pipelines in Spark on Google Cloud.

Outside of academics, I have held three internships in both frontend and backend engineering. At Hayver, in addition to engineering, I advised the CEO and other business leaders in the transition from a legacy Prolog system to a modern microservice architecture. This experience taught me that the most important skill of an engineer is the ability to present findings clearly to any audience. To that end, my time as an officer of Deep Learning @ UGA has given me the opportunity to present machine learning concepts to both technical and non-technical peers.

I am excited about the opportunity to join The Home Depot, and I thank you for your time and consideration.
