\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Chris, and I am an upcoming data scientist and software engineer. I am currently wrapping up my master's degree in artificial intelligence at the University of Georgia, for which I have completed all course work. I have a strong background in engineering, artificial intelligence, and data science, with bachelor degrees in both computer science and cognitive science, along with multiple internships in software engineering. As my graduate studies come to a close, I am seeking full-time employment in Atlanta where I can leverage data science and engineering to solve real world problems and build systems to bring those solutions to scale.

\lettersection{Why MailChimp?}
Engineering data systems is the perfect synthesis of my education and experience. My ambition goes beyond simply mining information from data to building the systems that enable this process, both internal and customer facing. MailChimp is in a unique position to democratize data driven insights for small companies that might not have data scientists or engineers, and that excites me. Even more, MailChimp is consistently ranked among the best tech companies to work for in the South, and living and working in Atlanta is important to me.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My master's thesis has centered around data science with high dimensional numeric datasets. I have developed a netCDF data ingestion pipeline to enable further statistical analysis in a distributed setting. I have utilized several modeling frameworks, including gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. This work has leveraged Scikit-learn and PyTorch, and I have experience developing and deploying big data pipelines in Spark on Google Cloud.

Outside of academics, I have held three internships in both frontend and backend engineering. At Hayver, in addition to engineering, I advised the CEO and other business leaders in the transition from a legacy Prolog system to a modern microservice architecture. This experience taught me that the most important skill of an engineer is the ability to present findings clearly to any audience. To that end, my time as an officer of Deep Learning @ UGA has given me the opportunity to present data science concepts to both technical and non-technical peers.

I am excited about the opportunity to join MailChimp, and I thank you for your time and consideration.
