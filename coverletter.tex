\lettersection{About Me}
I am Chris Barrick, an aspiring software engineer with experience in machine learning and data science. I am currently a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Georgia where I previously achieved bachelor's degrees in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I have studied cognitive systems from the perspectives of Computer Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and Philosophy, and my interests include knowledge based systems, natural language processing, and backend systems engineering.

\lettersection{Why IBM?}
First and foremost, I appreciate the ``strength'' of IBM's position on artificial intelligence. While most businesses have machine learning applications these days, they are almost always for single purpose applications, making them relatively weak forms of AI. Watson's ability to fit on any domain and communicate naturally is simply the strongest form of AI that currently exists. And it's not just Watson; all of IBM's investments in AI seem (from the outside) to bet on a future of strong AI more so than those of the other firms, and that excites me. A second and more practical point I appreciate about IBM is the distributed nature of the organization. While I'm not opposed to relocating anywhere in the US, IBM has many more opportunities in the southeast than any other company of its size, and the potential to work relatively near to my family and friends is a definite plus.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I attribute the success of IBM's investments in AI to an embrace of cognitive systems beyond machine learning alone, and I believe that my background in AI is similarly diverse. In addition to my knowledge of modern machine learning frameworks like Spark and PyTorch, I have deep experience with Prolog, a powerful tool in old-school knowledge based systems and natural language processing for which experienced developers are rare. (Rumor is early versions of Watson leveraged Prolog.) And although I am an entry-level candidate, I bring with me a strong education and both internship and research experience.

I thank you for your consideration.
