\lettersection{About Me}
This letter is to express my interest in your recent opening for a knowledge engineer in the Atlanta area. With Bachelor's degrees in both Computer and Cognitive Science, multiple internships, and a Master's in Artificial Intelligence in progress, I am confident that I will be an asset to your team. My education and interests are broadly in AI and cognitive science and specifically in knowledge based systems and machine learning. I am seeking a position that will challenge me to grow as an engineer both technically and socially.

I am currently a master's student at UGA in Athens. While I will not graduate until the end of summer, I will finish my course requirements by May, after which nothing will be tying me to Athens. I am available to start May 7th.

\lettersection{Why IBM?}
As a project, Watson hits right at the heart of my interests by using machine learning to bridge the gap between unstructured data and classic knowledge based systems. I understand that the advertising team is now the largest user of Watson APIs. My intent is to get a foot in the door, to gain experience from senior engineers in AI, and to use and contribute back to Watson. The role of knowledge engineer specifically excites me as this first step because it alines well with my existing skills and interests.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My academic achievements should speak for themselves: I am well decorated with relevant course work across five departments. As an engineer, I am both flexible and talented. I have related work experience from three companies in tech. I am experienced with multiple machine learning and knowledge base stacks including Spark/Hadoop, the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas), and Prolog. And I know a variety of languages across multiple paradigms, which gives me a large toolset and the capacity to quickly learn more. Additionally, I familiar with existing team members, having worked with Peilong at Digital Envoy and studied with Nicholas at UGA.
